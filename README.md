# Ideas for projects

A repo of ideas for projects that I have. Feel free to use them in any way you want.

## Jiffy Reactions
Service where you can submit reaction GIFs. Files will be approved by an admin and then added to a repo where everyone can use them. Tent will serve as the back-end, using the file post type, and posting a Status message for every newly entered GIF.

## Gint Issues
Tent-GitHub issues integration. Post a status message when you: 

* Open an issue
* Respond to an issue
* Commit on an issue
* Reference an issue
* Close an issue
* Reopen an issue

Possibly prefix status message with something like `git` or `issue` or `github` with something to set off the prefix, like `[word]` or `word ->` or some other character symbol. Of course link directly to issue, possibly using a link shortener (bit.ly). Content could be something like:

```markdown
**[issue]** I just `opened` issue #226 on @ababsurdo's repo, `js-shiv`. Check it out: http://bit.ly/IqT6zt.
```

resulting in: 

**[issue]** I just `opened` issue #226 on @ababsurdo's repo, `js-shiv`. Check it out: http://bit.ly/IqT6zt.
