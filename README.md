# Ideas for projects

A repo of ideas for projects that I have. Feel free to use them in any way you want.


## Node.js App Ideas to Learn From

### Pay with a post

Pay with a post mentioning the product on one or more social networks.

### Beta invitation drop-in module 
![Good First Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Good%20First%20Project-43fd94.svg)

Signup with a beta invite, generated, sent, and validated by the module.


### GitHub/Twitter Inactive Username Checker

Checks for GitHub/Twitter usernames, optionally matching a given term, that are inactive. While this doesn't really help on Twitter yet (they've got a policy that they don't reassign or delete inactive accounts), you can possibly get a good GitHub username with it.


### Avatar selector on GH-pages (Gravatar alternative)
![Good First Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Good%20First%20Project-43fd94.svg)

A Node script to build a site that allows the user to select an avatar from a GitHub Pages URL via Query String. I want my main avatar? I can link or go to `bnb.github.io/avatars/index.html?avatar=1`. There could be multiple linking paths (`?avatar=1`, `?avatar=main`, `?avatar=current`, `?avatar=first`, `?a=1`, etc.) and other features.

### Anchorify anything
![Good First Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Good%20First%20Project-43fd94.svg)

Add an anchor link to any element on a website, via anchorify as a proxy, to link directly to that specific element.


### Link it forward
![Good First Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Good%20First%20Project-43fd94.svg)

Link it forward allows the HTML author to link to pages that don't currently exist, but _will exist in the future_. There will be a visual representation of the link that tells the reader if the link currently exists or not. Based off the idea of linking to the next post in a series of blog posts before it's published, so readers in the future can go to the next post without the author needing to edit the original.


### 1-click npm installs from README.md
![Good First Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Good%20First%20Project-43fd94.svg)

No idea if this is even possible. Develop a button for OSS projects to put in their README.md files that either 1-click copies the install command or just installs the package. This could be plain HTML (piggybacking off the C&P from the GitHub sidebar?) or a browser extension. 


### Pastebin-style site

...with beautify and uglify scripts, linters, markdown editing, and whatever else you think of.


### GitHub API to HTML render of projects for a portfolio display
![Intermediate Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Intermediate Project-4394fd.svg)

Render an embedible piece with your repositories/statistics/whatever else from the GitHub API that can be dropped into a personal site, either as an entire page, or as a small section. 


### WebPush
![Intermediate Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Intermediate Project-4394fd.svg)

Either an OSS self-hosted project or a hosted project, this is a Node/Express site that hooks into popular site's APIs and sends push notifications to the desktop via the Notifications API.


### Note to Self (nts.me?)
![Intermediate Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Intermediate Project-4394fd.svg)

Leave a note to yourself, set to send a notification via a variety of media. It could send a tweet, email, sms, etc. to alert you given the parameters you specified.


### Humans.json, an API for humans that contributed.

![Complex Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Complex%20Project-fd4394.svg)
Based off of the [me-api](https://github.com/danfang/me-api), Humans.json is Humans.txt as an API. Essentially, a collection of me-api elements, as well as organizational-specific features. I have humansjson.com in the event that someone wants to use it.


### Scaffolding.json
![Complex Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Complex%20Project-fd4394.svg)

A command line tool that builds the scaffolding of programming projects in plain English. Returns a json file to reference.


### Desktop Website Builder with Metalsmith and Electron
![Complex Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Complex%20Project-fd4394.svg)

An Electron App with a GUI to build Metalsmith (metalsmith.io) websites.


## Team Fortress 2
### Resume.tf
![Intermediate Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Intermediate Project-4394fd.svg)

Resumes for Team Fortress 2 competitive players


## School

### HP 302/IS 124
![Intermediate Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Intermediate Project-4394fd.svg)

For my Honors Project, perhaps I could set up an agreement with the professor where the students can exchange time spent on OSS/pull requests sent on GitHub to C++ projects for 0.5% final grade score, for a max of 3-4%.


## Random 

### Quote Engine
