# Ideas for projects

A repo of ideas for projects that I have. Feel free to use them in any way you want.

## Jiffy Reactions
Service where you can submit reaction GIFs. Files will be approved by an admin and then added to a repo where everyone can use them. Tent will serve as the back-end, using the file post type, and posting a Status message for every newly entered GIF.
